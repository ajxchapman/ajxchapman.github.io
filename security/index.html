    <p>Hi, my name is <a href="https://twitter.com/ajxchapman">Alex</a>, I’ve been an IT security professional since 2007 and I’ve recently entered the start-up world with my project <a href="https://bughuntr.io">bughuntr.io</a>. In putting together this project, security has been a primary concern for me. This is both due to my background and the nature of the project, being a training platform for security professionals and enthusiasts alike. In my security career, I’ve been hired to assess countless web applications, cloud environments and computer networks for security vulnerabilities. In these assessments, it is always clear when security is ‘bolted on’ as a compliance requirement before releasing a product, or added at a later date in response to an incident. Start-ups have a rare opportunity to ‘bake’ security in at the start of a project, but this is often seen as an expensive endeavor. In this post, I aim to ease that fear and provide practical (and cheap) advice for start-ups who want to release a more secure product right from the start.</p>

    <p>In this post I examine techniques and optimizations which can be used to efficiently extract SQL query results from Blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities. With the correct techniques and optimizations the majority of SQL query results can be extracted using at most two requests per character in the result string plus two requests for a length check. Under certain conditions results may be able to be extracted using significantly fewer requests.</p>

<p>This post draws together known Blind SQL Injection data extraction techniques and builds upon them in order to reduce the number of requests required to extract query results to the absolute minimum.</p>

    <p>The subject of this blog, the LIFX light bulb, bills itself as the light bulb reinvented; a “WiFi enabled multi-color, energy efficient LED light bulb” that can be controlled from a smartphone [1]. We chose to investigate this device due to its use of emerging wireless network protocols, the way it came to market and its appeal to the technophile in all of us.</p>
