        <title>Practical Security Recommendations for Start-ups with Limited Budgets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ajxchapman&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been an IT security professional since 2007 and I’ve recently entered the start-up world with my project &lt;a href=&quot;https://bughuntr.io&quot;&gt;bughuntr.io&lt;/a&gt;. In putting together this project, security has been a primary concern for me. This is both due to my background and the nature of the project, being a training platform for security professionals and enthusiasts alike. In my security career, I’ve been hired to assess countless web applications, cloud environments and computer networks for security vulnerabilities. In these assessments, it is always clear when security is ‘bolted on’ as a compliance requirement before releasing a product, or added at a later date in response to an incident. Start-ups have a rare opportunity to ‘bake’ security in at the start of a project, but this is often seen as an expensive endeavor. In this post, I aim to ease that fear and provide practical (and cheap) advice for start-ups who want to release a more secure product right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bugcrowd Big Bugs: BitBucket Pipelines Kata Containers Build Container Escape</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Atlassian ran a project on Bugcrowd looking for bugs in their proposed implementation of Kata Containers within the Bitbucket Pipelines CI/CD environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the project, Researcher Alex Chapman (axjchapman) identified a vulnerability in Kata Containers which could allow processes running in the Kata VM to write to supposedly read-only volume mounts. Exploiting this vulnerability allowed a malicious build job to write semi-controlled data to arbitrary files on the host system as the root user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability was fixed by the Kata Containers team and assigned CVE-2020-28914.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Daily Swig - Container security: Privilege escalation bug patched in Docker Engine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability in a Docker Engine security feature potentially allowed attackers to escalate privileges from a remapped user to root.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The two avenues of exploitation I found would allow writing of arbitrary files as the real root user” or seizing ownership of files previously accessible only by the root user, security researcher Alex Chapman, who unearthed the flaw, tells The Daily Swig.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Moby - Access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real root</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability involving the –userns-remap option in which access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real root. When using “–userns-remap”, if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host filesystem they can modify files under “/var/lib/docker/&lt;remapping&gt;&quot; that cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent privilege escalation from remapped user.&lt;/remapping&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kata Containers `hostPath` file write</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bugcrowd bug report to a Private Program:&lt;/strong&gt; Kata Containers was found to be vulnerable to an issue allowing Kata VMs to write to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hostPath&lt;/code&gt; mount points which should have been read only. This issue was fixed in the Kata Containers project and assigned CVE-2020-28914.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Privileged Container Escape - Control Groups release_agent</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently been doing a lot of bug hunting in containerized environments, and one common theme has been escaping a container to execute code on the container host. In this post I’ll expand on a technique reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_fel1x&quot;&gt;Felix Wilhelm (@_fel1x)&lt;/a&gt; to escape a privileged container to execute arbitrary commands on the container host.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kata Containers - Improper file permissions for read-only volumes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An improper file permissions vulnerability affects Kata Containers prior to 1.11.5. When using a Kubernetes hostPath volume and mounting either a file or directory into a container as readonly, the file/directory is mounted as readOnly inside the container, but is still writable inside the guest. For a container breakout situation, a malicious guest can potentially modify or delete files/directories expected to be read-only.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GitLab - GitLab-Runner on Windows `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` container host Command Injection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HackerOne bug report to GitLab:&lt;/strong&gt; GitLab-Runner, when running on Windows with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; executor, is vulnerable to Command Injection via the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG&lt;/code&gt; build variable. Injected commands are executed on the container host, not within a Docker container, as such could compromise all future builds which are executed by the runner.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Daily Swig - Collaborative bug hunting ‘could be very lucrative’ – security pro Alex Chapman on the future of ethical hacking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“It all started with a Commodore 64, but Alex Chapman’s passion for programming crystalized into an interest in ethical hacking following a careers advice day at university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since graduating in computer science in 2007, the London-based vulnerability researcher has worked in pen testing, red teaming, and security research during stints at Deloitte, Context Information Security, and Yahoo.”&lt;/p&gt;
