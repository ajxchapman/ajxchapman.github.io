title: 44Con 2014 - Hacking an Internet Enabled Lagomorph
category: presentations
---

So, I have to admit, I got a little obsessed with this project. Who would have thought an internet enabled, hyperkinetic, 9.6-inch rabbity thing could hold so much intrigue. Little did I know that in procuring this geek toy I’d be delving down the proverbial rabbit hole of ARM exploitation, including reverse engineering, cross compiling, protocol analysis, 0days and producing exploits from vulnerability advisories. All this in an attempt to get remote code execution… on a rabbit… seriously!

Throughout this talk I will discuss the processes and procedures used to identify and eventually exploit vulnerabilities on the Karotz “smart companion” (what else would I be talking about?). Vulnerabilities identified include authentication bypass, jump table corruptions and heap overflows which eventually lead to unauthenticated ear wiggling exploits. I wonder if this qualifies for a CVE? A couple of remote code execution bugs will also be discussed.
